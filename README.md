# Logistics Performance Enhancement: Hypothesis Testing and Predictive Modeling
This project investigates key factors influencing customer behavior and feedback in a retail environment. Using a combination of hypothesis testing, statistical analysis, and machine learning models, we analyzed the impact of demographics, purchasing behavior, and shipping methods on customer satisfaction. The project includes:

Key Objectives:
Hypothesis Development: Formulated and tested three hypotheses related to age groups, gender differences, and shipping methods' influence on feedback.
Predictive Modeling: Designed an XGBoost classifier to predict "Excellent" feedback scores, achieving an 18% improvement in prediction accuracy.

Statistical Analysis:
Conducted ANOVA and Tukey HSD tests to compare feedback across shipping methods.
Used Chi-Square tests and Cram√©r's V to examine the association between shipping methods and customer preferences.

Dataset:
Sourced from Kaggle, comprising over 300,000 records of customer transactions, demographics, product categories, and feedback.

Tools and Techniques:
Machine Learning: XGBoost classifier for prediction and feature importance analysis.
Statistical Methods: ANOVA, Chi-Square tests, and regression modeling for hypothesis testing.
Visualization: Box plots, bubble charts, and bar charts for insights into shipping methods and customer satisfaction.

Insights:
Highlighted the significant influence of "Same-Day" shipping on positive feedback, particularly for time-sensitive products like electronics and clothing.
Identified key predictors of customer satisfaction, enabling data-driven recommendations for operational improvements.
Technologies Used:

Python (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn)
Jupyter Notebook for data analysis and visualization

This repository provides the full analysis, including code, statistical outputs, and actionable managerial insights.
